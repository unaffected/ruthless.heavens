If you could seize power, would you take it? What price would you pay? To what end would you go?

Ruthless Heavens is a fast-paced, competitive deck-building game in which players strive to reach the peaks of power. 

Set in a brutal fantasy world where the very fabric of existence is defined by its denizens relentless pursuit for power. Here, all know woe, and even the heavens are ruthless.

There are countless paths to the summit, all treacherous. Every decision a gamble. Every gamble life or death.

Be warned, most who pursue the summit end up joining the countless fools and cowards whose corpses litter its base, and all those that brave its slopes quickly realize that power is a merciless master.

Tread lightly and choose wisely, but be bold and seize opportunity. There's no room at the summit for the meek. Spite the heavens and the claim the peaks.
