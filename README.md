# Ruthless Heavens

If you could have power, would you take it? What would you give? To what end?

Ruthless Heavens is a fast-paced, competitive deck-building game. Set in the brutal fantasy world of Einai where all know woe, the very fabric of existence is defined by the unyielding pursuit of power, and even the heavens are ruthless.

Most who pursue the peaks of power join the countless fools and cowards whose corpses litter the base, and even those barely up the slopes quickly realize power is a merciless master.

There are countless paths to the summit, but they’re all long and treacherous. Every step a twist. Every twist a decision. Every decision a gamble.

Tread lightly and choose wisely. Be bold and seize opportunity. Spite the heavens and the claim the peaks.
